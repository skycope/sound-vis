# Sound Vis

A minimal, low-latency audio visualizer that turns active frequency zones into
persistent "voice" entities drifting across a calm, evolving landscape.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL from Vite and allow microphone access.

## Notes

- Prioritize low latency over extra features.
- The visuals are meant to feel smooth and organic, not glitchy or fast.
- Voices are tracked as persistent frequency peaks that return and drift.
